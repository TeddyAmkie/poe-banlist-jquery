# Poe.trade seller blacklist

Simple extension to hide sellers from your trade search results, for whatever reason.

After installing the extension you'll find a new button besides "Whisper" which adds the seller to your personal blacklist:

![Search results block button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max-arias/poeTradeIgnoreList/master/readmeImages/image_1.png)

Once the seller has been added to the blacklist, he will not appear in the item search results nor the currency search results.

You can manage the blacklist from the extension icon.

Either removing users one by one, or removing them all:

![Manage blacklist users, remove one or all](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max-arias/poeTradeIgnoreList/master/readmeImages/image_2.png)

You can also add users manually, one per line:

![Manage blacklist users, add many](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/max-arias/poeTradeIgnoreList/master/readmeImages/image_3.png)
